<div dir="ltr">I remember like it was yesterday.. I came from Glassfish, worked with JBoss and Tomcat and had to develop on WebSphere. Installing WebSphere was the start of my "wtf driven development" career. It was incomprehensible for me why this application server takes gigabytes while all the others I've seen before took just a few megabytes. The next shock after installation I got while starting and deploying my application. A cold startup took about 30 seconds. First I thought I accidentally added the application, but this was a application server start only. Wtf?! Seriously? There was no deployed application, no additional application libraries which had to be initialized while startup or something else, just the plain application server start. This was definitely the highlight of my wtf-driven career. <br />Developing on a different application server than the productive one in my opinion is awkward and I searched for additional solutions to minimize my "wtf"-rate.<br />So I tried WebSphere Liberty Profile.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">These experiences with Liberty I will consolidate in the next sections.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><b>Dynamically Adding Features Without Restart</b><br />After just a few days of developing WebSphere 6.1 and 8.0. I was searching for the imaginary disable button to throw off the unnecessary ballast like MQ and other stuff. The startup, deployment and re-deployment time was still terrible and frustrating for the whole team.<br />Liberty Profile luckily eliminates this frustration. Unused features like MQ or other Java EE Full Profile libraries can be removed and the application server can be tailored to the needs of the deployed application(s). It's a bit like puzzling. Whereas the developer defines the final result of the puzzle.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><b>Less horrible configuration</b><br />In my opinion every installation and configuration of WebSphere 8.0 inclusive all former releases is different. There are lots of configuration files and it is hard to completely recreate all the configurations of a productive environment. It's like searching the needle in a haystack in case of issues. </div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">With Liberty in comparison to former WebSphere releases it is so easy to share the server configuration. The server configuration is unlike the older WebSphere versions centered in a single confgurations file named server.xml. Thus it is easier to keep the productive and the developers environment similar and comparable. That's great! Before Liberty Profile, WebSphere had a large amount of configuration files and it was pretty hard to recreate the configured production environment.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><b>Easier Installation</b><br />I have finished the installation after just a few minutes. I remember .. after installing WebSphere Liberty Profile the first time I was confused about the non-existing struggling while initial installation and configuration.<br />Times of installing lots of gigabyte installations have gone using Liberty. </div><div dir="ltr">This pretty fast installation is great. Switching teams with a WAS production environment is easier and faster than never before. Installing WebSphere does not need hours of installation and configuration and you can't become unproductive anymore.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><b>Smaller Footprint</b><br />The Liberty Profile <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/">download</a> from WASdev takes 50mb only. Downloading Eclipse Kepler SR2 takes additional 250mb and installing the WebSphere Developer Tools results in a sum of round about 500mb. This is a pretty lightweight environment.<br />Nevertheless a NetBeans Plugin would be nice to get a more lightweight alternative to Eclipse.</div><div dir="ltr">It would be a nice community gift which maybe would increase the Liberty community by offering plugins for IntelliJ and NetBeans.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><b>Conclusion</b><br />Overall Liberty Profile is a giant step forward in comparison to the former WebSphere releases, but there is one thing I am missing. There is no Ops friendly lightweight admin interface. The Eclipse plugin is great from a developers perspective, but Ops could be afraid of an update to Liberty. If someone already knows how to solve this issue, please leave a comment.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">These are just a few of my experiences. Maybe some of them will change in future, but from a WebSphere Developer's point of view the Liberty Profile is a giant step forward and the taunting "WebsFear" could disappear from the community.. In my opinion Liberty Profile is a great chance to create a larger WebSphere developer community.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">..

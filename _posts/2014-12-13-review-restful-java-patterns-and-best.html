It is available since three months and I really looked forward to get it. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/PacktPub">Packt Publishing</a> for giving me this copy. <br /><br /><b>Introduction</b><br />The convergence of social networking, cloud computing, and the era of  mobile applications has created a generation of emerging technologies  that allow different networked devices to communicate with each other  over the Internet with REST. REST has the benefits of being stateless;  easing scalability, visibility, and reliability; and being platform and  language agnostic.<br />This book is a practical, hands-on guide that  provides you with clear and pragmatic information to take advantage of  the real power of RESTful services and gives you a good foundation for  using them in your applications. By comparing APIs from platforms such  as Facebook, Twitter, GitHub and PayPal, the book teaches a range of  exciting capabilities with RESTful services and explores the infinite  possibilities by using the diverse building blocks and tips covered in  various chapters.<br />By the end of the book, you will be able to  successfully use the concepts explained to design and implement  applications based on best practices for RESTful services.<br /><br /><b><b>Product Details</b> </b><br />Paperback: 131 pages<br />Publisher: Packt Publishing - ebooks Account (September 19, 2014)<br />Language: English<br />ISBN-10: 1783287969<br />ISBN-13: 978-1783287963<br /><br /><b><b>The Author</b></b><br />Bhakti Mehta (<a href="https://twitter.com/bhakti_mehta">@bhakti_mehta</a>) is the author of Developing RESTful Services  with JAX-RS 2.0, WebSockets, and JSON, Packt Publishing, published in  2013. She has more than 13 years of experience in architecting,  designing, and implementing software solutions on top of Java EE and  other related technologies. She is passionate about open source software  development and has been one of the founding members of GlassFish Open  Source Application Server. <br />Bhakti has a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and a Master's  degree in Computer Science. Her areas of research include architecting  solutions for resiliency, scalability, reliability, and performance with  respect to server-side technologies, web services, and cloud  applications.<br /><div class="book-info-bottom-author-body" itemprop="description"></div><br /><b><b>Summary</b></b><br />Chapter 1, REST - Where it Begins, starts with basic concepts of REST, like how to design RESTful services and best practices around designing REST resources.<br />Chapter 2<b><b><b>, </b></b></b>Resource Design discusses different request and response patterns. It covers topics such as content negotiation, resource versioning and response codes.<br />Chapter 3, Security and Traceability, covers advanced details in security and traceability around the REST API. It includes topics such as access control, authentication using OAuth, excpetion handling,  auditing and validation patterns.<br />Chapter 4, Designing for Performance, covers the design principles needed for performance. It discusses the caching principles, asynchronous and long running jobs in REST, and how to use partial updates using PATCH.<br />Chapter 5, Advanced Design Principles, covers advanced topics such as rate limiting, response pagination, and internationalization and localization principles with detailed samples. It covers extensibility, HATEOAS, and topics such as testing and documenting REST services.<br />Chapter 6, Emerging Standards and the Future of REST, covers real-time APIs using WebHooks, WebSockets, PuSH, and Server send services, and compares and contrasts them in various areas. Additionally, this chapter covers case studies demonstrating how the emerging technologies such as WebSockets and WebHooks are being used in real-time applications. It also outlines the role of REST with micro services.<br />Appendix, covers different REST API from GitHub, Twitter, and Facebook, and how they tie into the principles discussed in the former chapters.<br /><br /><b><b>Analysis of Content</b></b><br />The book starts with beginners friendly introduction to the basic concepts of REST. This first chapter also covers lots of general best practices and tips for REST beginners.<br />It is clearly written and can easily be understood by non-natives. After reading the beginners chapter the reader is well prepared for the subsequent chapters.<br />Most of its chapters are written in a brief and pithy way whereas the reader doesn't miss any information. <span class="_5yl5" data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$6:0">Solely the "HATEOAS"  chapter is too short and </span></span></span><span class="_5yl5" data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$6:0"><span class="_5yl5" data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$6:0">unlike the other ones, it doesn't </span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="_5yl5" data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418416986802=2b2779663bfdec27681.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$6:0">contain code  examples</span></span></span>.<span class="_5yl5" data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418417343866=221077be1bd163e1b01.2:0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418417343866=221077be1bd163e1b01.2:0.0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418417343866=221077be1bd163e1b01.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$0:0"><br /></span></span></span><br />Nevertheless the comparisons of best practices are great. The reader gets a overview of different proven approaches and is able to apply the best one in the respective situation. <br /><br /><b><b>Conclusion and Recommendation</b></b><br />Unlike described the book is not an advanced one. Most of these elementary topics should also be well understood by non advanced REST developers. The book is great for getting started on a higher level than the Hello World one and it is a very good reference book <span class="_5yl5" data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418418119518=24d9d841f162327a014.2:0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418418119518=24d9d841f162327a014.2:0.0.0.0.0.0"><span data-reactid=".4y.$mid=11418418119518=24d9d841f162327a014.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$0:0">offering</span></span></span> lots of memorable tips. If I didn't get this from Packt, I would have bought it on my own.<br /><br /><b>Brief Summary</b><br />A good book for everyone who wants to get a brief overview&nbsp;of common REST practices and an ideal reference book.<br /><br /><a class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false" href="https://twitter.com/bennetelli">Follow @bennetelli</a><br /><script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>

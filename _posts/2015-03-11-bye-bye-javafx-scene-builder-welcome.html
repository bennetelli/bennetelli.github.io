Oracle won't provide installers anymore.<br />In my opinion it's a shame. It was pretty easy installing and working with Scene Builder especially for JavaFX newcommers, but <a href="http://gluonhq.com/">Gluon</a> closes this gap. They will provide builds of Scene Builder as before as installers for Max OS X, Linux, Windows or simply as an executable jar file.<br />cially for JavaFX newcommers, but <br /><br /><b>What does it mean for JavaFX developers and especially for beginners?</b><br /><br />no fear.. nothing at this stage :-) You simply have to <a href="http://gluonhq.com/products/downloads/">download</a> Scene Builder Gluon's page instead of the Oracle one. Everything else is the same as before.<br />Scene Builder looks and feels like before. Also updating from Scene Builder 2.0 to Gluon Scene Builder 8.0.0 is quite easy. You have to install it via .deb or something else. It doesn't matter if you already have a former Scene Builder installation on your machine. It simply will be updated. It's the same as with former JavaFX Scene Builder releases like 2.0 :-)<br /><br />Thanks <a href="http://gluonhq.com/">Gluon</a> for providing and supporting this great tool. It stays beginners friendly and keeps JavaFX developers productivity on a high level.<br /><br /><u>Notice:</u> Is already built with Java 8. Update 40 so you also need this JDK version for running  Scene Builder.<br /><br /><u>Links:</u><br /><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/sb2download-2177776.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/sb2download-2177776.html</a><br /><a href="http://gluonhq.com/gluon-supports-scene-builder/">http://gluonhq.com/gluon-supports-scene-builder/</a><br /><a href="http://gluonhq.com/scene-builder-installers-now-available/">http://gluonhq.com/scene-builder-installers-now-available/</a><br /><br /><br /><a class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false" href="https://twitter.com/bennetelli">Follow @bennetelli</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>

    Some days ago I got in contact with IoT and MQTT with the great MQTT.fx tool developed by Jens Deters (<a
        href="https://twitter.com/Jerady" target="_blank"><u>@jerady</u></a>) and I wanted to deepen my knowledge about
    Message Brokers/Message-oriented Middleware, so I bought this book about Apache ActiveMQ.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Applications in enterprises need to communicate, most commonly done by messaging.
    <br/>
    Apache ActiveMQ is an open-source implementation of the Java Message Service (JMS), which provides messaging in Java
    applications.
    <br/>
    <i>ActiveMQ in Action </i>is a thorough, practical guide to implementing message-oriented systems using ActiveMQ and
    Java.
    Co-authored by one of the leading ActiveMQ developers, Bruce Snyder, the book starts with the anatomy of a core Java
    message, then moves quickly through fundamentals including data persistence, authentication and authorization.
    Later chapters cover advanced features such as configuration and performance tuning, illustrating each concept with
    a running real-world stock portfolio application.
    <br/>
    Readers will learn to integrate ActiveMQ with Apache Geronimo and JBoss, and tie into both Java and non-Java
    technologies including AJAX, .NET, C++, Ruby, and the Spring framework.

<h2>The Content</h2>
<p>
    This books covers all you need to know about ActiveMQ in different scenarios.
    It starts with introductions to Apache ActiveMQ and gives an understanding of message-oriented middleware and JMS.
    <br/>
    After that this book shows basic topics like how to connect to ActiveMQ, Storing messages, securing ActiveMQ and
    integrations to Java and Java EE applications.
    In the advanced parts it is about deployments, performance tuning, administration and so on.
</p>

<h2>Writing and Style</h2>
<p>
    If you are used to technical documentation you shouldn't struggle with this book.
    For a non native speaker it reads very easy.
    I didn't find very many complex sentences which were too complex for non natives.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Recommendation</h2>
<p>
    If you have some knowledge of Java, this book offers all you need to master ActiveMQ from the beginning to advanced
    topics.
    <br/>
    I really enjoyed reading this book and it will take a place as reference book on my desk.
    <br/>
    If you are interested in Message Brokers and Message oriented Middleware solutions and want a book which covers
    everything from configuration over performance tuning to administration and monitoring of ActiveMQ, this is good
    choice.

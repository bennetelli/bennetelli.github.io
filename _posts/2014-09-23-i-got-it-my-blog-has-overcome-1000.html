It's some days ago that my blog took the 1000 visitors hurdle. Nevertheless the time still has come to say thanks to more than 1.000 readers from 14 different countries who visited my blog within the last three months.<br /><br />Thanks for all the feedback and encouragements for my blog posts! It's a great feeling to get positive feedback  especially from unknown peoples all over the world. <br /><br />My last blog post is some days ago. Actually I am involved in some other development activities I don't wanna write about, because there are already lots of other blog posts about. Stay tuned! I will be back soon :-)

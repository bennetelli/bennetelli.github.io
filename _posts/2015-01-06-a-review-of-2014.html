First of all happy new year readers! After some fun days with family and friends I'm back on my blog at last.<br /><br />Thanks to round about 2500 readers during my first six months of blogging. It feels great that people read, like, comment and share my blog posts on different channels like twitter, google+&nbsp;and lots of others.<br /><br />After my presentation about JavaFX 8 at Ostfalia - University of Applied Sciences and some resultant blog posts about JavaFX the year 2015 will be more focused on Java Enterprise Edition and Enterprise Software in general. Learning and presenting JavaFX was fun, but JEE is what I like, love and in some brief moments hate, too ;-)<br /><br />In 2015 I want to surpass  an average of 2,5 blog posts per month. This hopefully result in a larger number of readers and also more feedback from the community. I am specially interested in negative and constructive feedback to improve my work, blog posts, my style of writing and the  blog in general. Of course positive feedback is welcome, too.<br /><br />Maybe I will also blog about different JSRs I am interested in. Enough talk! Let's&nbsp; start 2015. See you!<br /><br /><a class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false" href="https://twitter.com/bennetelli">Follow @bennetelli</a><script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>

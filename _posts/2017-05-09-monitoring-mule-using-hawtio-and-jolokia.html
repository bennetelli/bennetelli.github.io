    Most of my customers are using Mule Enterprise Edition which comes with the Mule Management Console <a href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-management-console/v/3.7/">(MMC)</a> which is really nice for monitoring of Mule Apps and Flows.
    Unfortunately its an Enterprise Feature and there is nothing similar for the Community Edition supported by MuleSoft.
    That's why I searched for Open Source Tools and decided to use hawtio for the monitoring of my customers Mule apps and flows.<br />
    This post describes how to connect hawtio with a standalone Mule Community Edition runtime by using jolokia for Remote JMS wit JSON over HTTP.
</p>

<h1>What is Jolokia?</h1>
<p>
    Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160 connectors.
    It is an agent based approach with support for many platforms.
    In addition to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX remoting with unique features like bulk requests and fine grained security policies.
</p>

<h1>Adding the Jolokia Agent to Mule</h1>
<p>
    Adding a jolokia agent to Mule is quite simple. First you have to <code class="shell plain"><a href="https://jolokia.org/download.html">download</a></code> the jolokia Mule-Agent.
    In the next step you have to add it to the <code class="shell plain">lib/opt</code> folder of your standalone Mule runtime.

    <div align="center">
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/jolokia-lib-opt.png">
            <img class="img-rounded" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/jolokia-lib-opt.png" width="80%" height="80%"/>
        </a>
    </div>

    <br />
    Just put the jolokia-mule-x.x.x-agent.jar in the <code class="shell plain">lib/opt</code> folder and open the <code class="shell plain">mule-config.xml</code> which is located in the <code class="shell plain">apps/default</code> folder.
    <br />
    <br />

    <div align="center">
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mule-config.png">
            <img class="img-rounded" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mule-config.png" width="80%" height="80%"/>
        </a>
    </div>

    <br />
    After that you have to add some XML Snippets to the empty <code class="shell plain">mule-config.xml</code> to add the jolokia Mule agent.
    <br />
    <br />

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/bennetelli/415dde3be8728fbb80fac8fe2483ca80.js"></script>

    In the last step you have to stop and start the Mule runtime via <code class="shell plain">./mule stop</code> and <code class="shell plain">./mule start</code> and test if it works correctly by calling: <code class="shell plain"><a href="http://localhost:8899/jolokia">http://localhost:8899/jolokia</a></code> in your browser of choice.
    <br />
    <br />

    <div align="center">
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/jolokia-chrome.png">
            <img class="img-rounded" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/jolokia-chrome.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>
        </a>
    </div>

    <u>Note:</u> Testing the jolokia installation via browser is the only way to test if it works correctly. The Mule Community Edition doesn't log registered agents anymore.
</p>

<h1>Connecting to Mule using hawtio</h1>
<p>
    After adding the agent to Mule you have to <a href="http://hawt.io/getstarted/index.html">download hawtio</a> and run it via console <code class="shell plain">java -jar hawtio-app-x.x.x.jar</code>.
    It takes some seconds until your primary browser opens the entry url <code class="shell plain">http://localhost:8080/hawtio</code>.

    <div align="center">
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hawtio-index.png">
            <img class="img-rounded" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hawtio-index.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>
        </a>
    </div>

    Now you can just click on <b>Connect to remote server</b> because we used the default port of jolokia which is also prefilled in this connections settings form.
    It takes some seconds until a Dashboard appears which shows CPU Load, Heap Memory Usage and some other stuff.
    <br />
    <br />
    <div align="center">
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hawtio-dashboard.png">
            <img class="img-rounded" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hawtio-dashboard.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>
        </a>
    </div>
</p>

<h1>Creating a Mule Dashboard for a Mule project and flow</h1>
<p>
    Beside this JVM Dashboard its also useful to create your own dashboards which show informations about every project and every single flow in detail.
    Therefore you can create a new custom dashboard which contains JMX informations about your flows. The following image shows such a dashboard with the Mule projects overall statistics and statistics for every single flow.

    <div align="center">
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hawtio-mule-dashboard.png">
            <img class="img-rounded" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hawtio-mule-dashboard.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>
        </a>
    </div>

    Sure, it's not that nice as the JVM Dashboard, but it contains a lot of informations about every flow and it's very helpful to get an understanding of your apps running on your environments.
    Maybe I will find some time to write a plugin or something like that to get a more beautiful visialization of Mule statistics.

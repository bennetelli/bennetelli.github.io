<p>For this entry, being the first, I would like to help the Ext-GWT community (especially those newly introduced to the framework) grasp a firm understanding of the reference "Mail" application, specifically the MVC structure found in this app. I have found that understanding these reference applications (especially the MVC) goes a long way toward using the Ext-GWT framework in a manner for which it was intended.</p>
<h3>Some pre-requisites</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Familiarity with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC design pattern</a></li>
    <li>Knowing how to put together a Google Web Toolkit application. See the <a http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT Documentation, as it is very good.</li>
    <li>Having downloaded the Ext-GWT (GXT) framework from <a href="http://www.extjs.com/products/gxt/download.php">Ext JS</a>. I will be using the code from the gxt-1.1.3 release.</li>
    <li>A brief perusal of the GXT code base and mail application source code</li>
</ul>
